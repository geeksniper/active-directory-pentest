### Active Directory Security Checks (by Sean Metcalf - @Pyrotek3)

#### General Recommendations
* Manage local Administrator passwords (LAPS).
* Implement RDP Restricted Admin mode (as needed).
* Remove unsupported OSs from the network.
* Monitor scheduled tasks on sensitive systems (DCs, etc.).
* Ensure that OOB management passwords (DSRM) are changed regularly & securely stored.
* Use SMB v2/v3+
* Default domain Administrator & KRBTGT password should be changed every year & when an AD admin leaves.
* Remove trusts that are no longer necessary & enable SID filtering as appropriate.
* All domain authentications should be set (when possible) to: "Send NTLMv2 response onlyrefuse LM & NTLM."
* Block internet access for DCs, servers, & all administration systems.

#### Protect Admin Credentials
* No "user" or computer accounts in admin groups.
* Ensure all admin accounts are "sensitive & cannot be delegated".
* Add admin accounts to "Protected Users" group (requires Windows Server 2012 R2 Domain Controllers, 2012R2 DFL for domain protection).
* Disable all inactive admin accounts and remove from privileged groups.

#### Protect AD Admin Credentials
* Limit AD admin membership (DA, EA, Schema Admins, etc.) & only use custom delegation groups.
* ‘Tiered’ Administration mitigating credential theft impact.
* Ensure admins only logon to approved admin workstations & servers.
* Leverage time-based, temporary group membership for all admin accounts

#### Protect Service Account Credentials
* Limit to systems of the same security level.
* Leverage “(Group) Managed Service Accounts” (or PW >20 characters) to mitigate credential theft (kerberoast).
* Implement FGPP (DFL =>2008) to increase PW requirements for SAs and administrators.
* Logon restrictions – prevent interactive logon & limit logon capability to specific computers.
* Disable inactive SAs & remove from privileged groups.

#### Protect Resources
* Segment network to protect admin & critical systems.
* Deploy IDS to monitor the internal corporate network.
* Network device & OOB management on separate network.

#### Protect Domain Controllers
* Only run software & services to support AD.
* Minimal groups (& users) with DC admin/logon rights.
* Ensure patches are applied before running DCPromo (especially MS14-068 and other critical patches).
* Validate scheduled tasks & scripts.

#### Protect Workstations (& Servers)
* Patch quickly, especially privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
* Deploy security back-port patch (KB2871997).
* Set Wdigest reg key to 0 (KB2871997/Windows 8.1/2012R2+): HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlSecurityProvidersWdigest
* Deploy workstation whitelisting (Microsoft AppLocker) to block code exec in user folders – home dir & profile path.
* Deploy workstation app sandboxing technology (EMET) to mitigate application memory exploits (0-days).

#### Logging
* Enable enhanced auditing
* “Audit: Force audit policy subcategory settings (Windows Vista or later) to override audit policy category settings”
* Enable PowerShell module logging (“*”) & forward logs to central log server (WEF or other method).
* Enable CMD Process logging & enhancement (KB3004375) and forward logs to central log server.
* SIEM or equivalent to centralize as much log data as possible.
* User Behavioural Analysis system for enhanced knowledge of user activity (such as Microsoft ATA).

#### Security Pro’s Checks
* Identify who has AD admin rights (domain/forest).
* Identify who can logon to Domain Controllers (& admin rights to virtual environment hosting virtual DCs).
* Scan Active Directory Domains, OUs, AdminSDHolder, & GPOs for inappropriate custom permissions.
* Ensure AD admins (aka Domain Admins) protect their credentials by not logging into untrusted systems (workstations).
* Limit service account rights that are currently DA (or equivalent).
